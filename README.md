# PHP pairs
----------
It is a simple card matching page.
The images are brought from a mysql database.
Some HTML, PHP and JS.

It's in development, not ready for production yet.

To do:
- Generate the cards from a PHP form and some graphic library.
- Pair with another card, not just with itself.
- Allow user registration, save the scores obtained, ranking, etc.
- Improve the visual presentation.
